# Scientific Calculator Python
Weâ€™ve created a simple Scientific Calculator GUI using Python that allows you to perform simple and complex calculations. 
To implement GUI we will use the <a href= 'https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-gui-tkinter/'>Tkinter</a> module of Python.
## Installation 
### To check Python

python --version
```
### To check pip

```
## Install Tkinter
Tkinter can be installed using pip. The following command is run in the command prompt to install Tkinter.
```bash

```
This command will start downloading and installing packages related to the Tkinter library. 
Once done, the message of successful installation will be displayed.
